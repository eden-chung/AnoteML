      "1. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks: Adverse economic conditions, such as inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment, and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending, leading to a decline in demand for the company's products and services. Uncertainty and decline in global or regional economic conditions can also impact the company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, and other channel partners, leading to financial instability, reduced liquidity, and declines in the fair value of the company's financial instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The pandemic has disrupted the company's supply chain, resulting in supply shortages and affecting sales worldwide. Public safety measures and reduced consumer demand in affected areas have also adversely impacted the company's products and services. The extent of the impact on the company's operational and financial performance remains uncertain and depends on factors such as the trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Political Events, Trade Disputes, and Business Interruptions: Political events, trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents, and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, adversely affecting the company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, and other channel partners. Trade policies, tariffs, and other measures that restrict international trade can materially adversely affect the company's business, particularly in regions where it derives a significant portion of its revenues and has significant supply chain operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Design and Manufacturing Defects: The company's products and services can be affected by design and manufacturing defects, which can interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and result in product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs, and significant warranty and other expenses. Quality problems can also harm the company's reputation, reduce market acceptance, and result in lost sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates: The company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. Weakening foreign currencies can adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, while strengthening foreign currencies can reduce international pricing and increase the cost of product components denominated in those currencies, impacting gross margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "These risks and uncertainties can impact the company's future performance by affecting demand for its products and services, increasing costs, disrupting the supply chain, damaging its reputation, reducing market acceptance, and leading to financial losses. The company's ability to effectively manage and mitigate these risks will be crucial in determining its future success.\n"

Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales andoperating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels asthese channels are ﬁlled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as thelaunch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a productintroduction.Human CapitalThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportiveenvironment for all of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalentemployees.Workplace Practices and PoliciesThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment ordiscrimination.Compensation and BeneﬁtsThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in theCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs andthe time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of beneﬁtsfor employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth anddevelopment.Inclusion and DiversityThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities itserves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and.
