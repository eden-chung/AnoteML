The offerings provide priorityaccess to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and inmany cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.Cloud ServicesThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windowspersonal computers.Digital ContentThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store, that allow customers to discover and download applications anddigital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.The Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade, a game subscription service;Apple Fitness+, a personalized ﬁtness service; Apple Music, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radiostations; Apple News+, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+, which offers exclusive original content and livesports.Payment ServicesThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay, a cashless payment service.Markets and DistributionThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets.The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sizedbusinesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. TheCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers andresellers. During 2022, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%,respectively, of total net sales.CompetitionThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition andresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolvingindustry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technologicaladvancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seekto compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing onits intellectual property.The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative newproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products,including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors importantto the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product andservice quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distributioncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.®\\n®®SM®®®®®\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm6/78The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables andaccessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have signiﬁcant technical,marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases.In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of activedevices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certaincompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no proﬁt or even at a loss. The Company’sservices compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digitalcontent and applications. The Company faces signiﬁcant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features andapplications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components arecurrently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in themarkets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company,including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and signiﬁcant commodity pricingﬂuctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by theCompany often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initialcapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continuedavailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production ofcommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Companywill be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, withsome Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability tocompete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely ﬂow of competitive products, services andtechnologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, andto expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.Intellectual PropertyThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices,accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rightsin the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is animportant factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarilyon the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company regularly ﬁles patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research,development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company hasaccumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right issolely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual propertyrights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectualproperty owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’sproducts, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonableterms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm7/78Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its ﬁrst quarter compared to other quarters in its ﬁscal year due in part toseasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales andoperating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels asthese channels are ﬁlled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as thelaunch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a productintroduction.Human CapitalThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportiveenvironment for all of its team members. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalentemployees.Workplace Practices and PoliciesThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment ordiscrimination.Compensation and BeneﬁtsThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in theCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs andthe time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of beneﬁtsfor employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth anddevelopment.Inclusion and DiversityThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities itserves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and supportequitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.EngagementThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open,collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to theirmanagers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas likecareer development, manager performance and inclusivity.Health and SafetyThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identiﬁes potential workplace risks inorder to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisismanagement training, and by putting speciﬁc programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally,the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. TheCompany has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.Available InformationThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments toreports ﬁled pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are ﬁledwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

When any one or more of these risks materialize from time totime, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price can be materially and adverselyaffected.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, pastﬁnancial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historicaltrends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations” and the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements andSupplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksThe Company’s operations and performance depend signiﬁcantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverseeconomic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. Inaddition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, includingmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance dependsigniﬁcantly on global and regional economic conditions.Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inﬂation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade,changes to ﬁscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency ﬂuctuations can adverselyimpact consumer conﬁdence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. Inaddition, consumer conﬁdence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to ﬁnancial market volatility, negativeﬁnancial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and costincreases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economicconditions can have a signiﬁcant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellularnetwork carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include ﬁnancial instability; inability to obtain credit to ﬁnance operationsand purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.A downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; thefailure of derivative counterparties and other ﬁnancial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reducedliquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s ﬁnancial instruments. These and other economic factors can materiallyadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price.The Company’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could inthe future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a signiﬁcant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to takeunprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closuresof businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times signiﬁcantly curtailed global economicactivity and caused signiﬁcant volatility and disruption in global ﬁnancial markets.The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the futurematerially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price. During the course of thepandemic, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienceddisruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safetymeasures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company’s products and services in affected areas.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm10/78The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations andrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and ﬁnancialperformance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectoryand duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccinesand treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demandfor consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for theCompany’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute itsstrategic plans, and the Company’s proﬁtability and cost structure.To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stockprice, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, naturaldisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents andother business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverseeffect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriersand other channel partners.The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and theCompany believes that it generally beneﬁts from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing isperformed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea,Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conﬂicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures thatrestrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, particularly if these measures occur in regionswhere the Company derives a signiﬁcant portion of its revenues and/or has signiﬁcant supply chain operations. For example, tensionsbetween the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as otherbusiness restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into makingthem. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make theCompany’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumerdemand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that couldadversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services asdesigned. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring businessrelationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with newor changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can beannounced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from suchmeasures. If disputes and conﬂicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be signiﬁcantly more severeand restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and otherinternational disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer conﬁdence and spending, which could adversely affect theCompany’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contractmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities aresubject to the risk of interruption by ﬁre, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacksand other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such asthe COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of naturaldisasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difﬁcult or impossible for the Company tomanufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefﬁciencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain,and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company canrequire substantial recovery time, experience signiﬁcant expenditures to resume operations, and lose signiﬁcant sales. Because theCompany relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruptionaffecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm11/78The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While theCompany’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and couldresult in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public healthissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adverselyaffect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective publicsafety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of productsbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of thesupply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufﬁcient to cover alllosses that may arise.Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change,and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competitionand resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles,evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technologicaladvancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative newproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products,including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must makesigniﬁcant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may notbe able to develop and market new products and services successfully.The Company currently holds a signiﬁcant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register,additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily throughaggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\\xa0intellectual property.Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company isunable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’sintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company facessubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have signiﬁcant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, aswell as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors havebroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense ascompetitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or coststructures to provide products at little or no proﬁt or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from timeto time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally, the Company faces signiﬁcant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications withintheir products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expectscompetition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings orwork collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have signiﬁcant resources and experience andhave established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content tousers for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continuallyimprove its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will beable to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm12/78Business RisksTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions andtransitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company mustcontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customerdemand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products andservices. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successfuldevelopment, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availabilityof application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line withanticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, andthe risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deﬁciencies. There can be no assurance the Company willsuccessfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners,many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia,including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a signiﬁcant concentration of this manufacturing iscurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supplychain require considerable time and resources and involve signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced muchof its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’sdirect control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverseeffect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s ﬂexibility to respond tochanging conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, theCompany generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects andexperiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its suppliercode of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components,and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for ﬁnal assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Anyfailure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or ﬁnished goods. Inaddition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to ﬁnal destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, includingnatural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conﬂict, economic, business,labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and hasmade prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure thesupply of components and ﬁnished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe ﬁnancial problems or otherdisruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing processequipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufﬁcient quantities on commerciallyreasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to signiﬁcant supplyand pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wideshortages and signiﬁcant commodity pricing ﬂuctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results ofoperations and ﬁnancial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages ofsupply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufﬁcient quantities ofcomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply ofmany components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Component suppliers may suffer from poor ﬁnancial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation withina particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufﬁcient quantities of components on commercially reasonableterms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’soperations and performance depend signiﬁcantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions canmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition,” above, can also affect the Company’sability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to signiﬁcant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcan materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm13/78Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm14/78The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses newtechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities haveincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons,including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet theCompany’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, orwhen an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results ofoperations and ﬁnancial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect theCompany’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. The Company’s business and ﬁnancial performance could also bematerially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufﬁcient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtainsufﬁcient quantities from an alternative source.The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that couldmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects.Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that canunexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and productsthe Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk ofenvironmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced intospecialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to timeexperience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed asanticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and ﬁx all issuesand defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issuesaffecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, productreplacements or modiﬁcations, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and signiﬁcant warrantyand other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory ﬁnes. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users ofthe Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor marketacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchasecommitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand,or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excessproducts and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventoryprepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determinesthat an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fairvalue. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitmentsare currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other chargesgiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periodsup to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is arisk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufﬁcient amounts of components or products, or not fullyutilize ﬁrm purchase commitments.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commerciallyreasonable terms or at all.The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses fromthose third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in thefuture may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products andservices can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has beennotiﬁed that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industrypractice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonableterms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failureto obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, canpreclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm15/78Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm16/78The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-partysoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain softwareapplications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed andmaintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on thedevelopers’ perception and analysis of the relative beneﬁts of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for theCompany’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personalcomputers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as themarket position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of productsales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers lessinclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing andupgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competingplatforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products.The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unableto or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improvedcustomer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisﬁed customers.The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developerskeep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales ofdigital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actionstaken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. Newlegislative initiatives, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The Company is alsosubject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices,and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developersfor access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and thecommission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on suchsales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancialcondition could be materially adversely affected.Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available oncommercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations andﬁnancial condition.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offersubscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate speciﬁc content into the Company’s own services. The licensingor other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation orrenewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currentlyor in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difﬁcult or impossible for the Company tolicense or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to,or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commerciallyreasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent,content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additionalrestrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. Ifrequirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be noassurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 15}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm17/78The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availabilityof highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and service ofkey personnel, including its Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in thetechnology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of theCompany’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If theCompany does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture,reputation and operational ﬂexibility.The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a signiﬁcant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurtureits culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical toits success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancialcondition.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers,many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise andgovernment customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer ﬁnancing, installment payment plans or subsidies forusers’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including stafﬁng selected resellers’ storeswith Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantialinvestment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The ﬁnancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers couldstop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could causeresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused bynatural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical orelectronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and othercontinuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recoveryplanning may not be sufﬁcient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, amongother things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturingand shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results ofoperations and ﬁnancial condition.Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of conﬁdential information, including personal information, could subject theCompany to signiﬁcant reputational, ﬁnancial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store conﬁdential information, including personal information, with respect to theCompany’s customers and employees. The Company devotes signiﬁcant resources to network and data security, including through theuse of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolutesecurity, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of conﬁdential information occur and could materially adversely affect theCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.The Company’s business also requires it to share conﬁdential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies onglobal suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although theCompany takes steps to secure conﬁdential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’sbehalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of conﬁdential information occur. Suchincidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations andﬁnancial condition.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm18/78The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. Theseattacks seek to compromise the conﬁdentiality, integrity or availability of conﬁdential information or disrupt normal business operations,and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact theCompany’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations,which could result in penalties, ﬁnes or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in bothfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoiddetection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover fromincidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conﬂict.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to conﬁdential information, including personal information, affect many companiesacross various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high proﬁle and the value of theconﬁdential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and preventunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryptionand authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufﬁcient for all eventualities and may bevulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or otherirregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosinguser names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or itsvendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologieslike multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspiciouscircumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to theCompany’s products and services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurancecoverage may be insufﬁcient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks notoriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancialcondition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involvesigniﬁcant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities andexpenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries,inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and signiﬁcant write-offs. Investment and acquisitiontransactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or theimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit theCompany’s ability to fully realize the anticipated beneﬁts of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not besuccessful. The failure of any signiﬁcant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results ofoperations and ﬁnancial condition.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resourcesand are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems,inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have beendesigned and built to serve as high-proﬁle venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations andsize, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structureassociated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiplestores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in signiﬁcant leasetermination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact theCompany’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effecton general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction andoperation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with ﬂuctuations in the value of retail inventory;and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm19/78Legal and Regulatory Compliance RisksThe Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results oflegal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course ofbusiness and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by theCompany sometimes include indemniﬁcation provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claimagainst an indemniﬁed third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, andthe alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continueto increase.The Company has faced and continues to face a signiﬁcant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and newclaims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seekroyalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. TheCompany is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in variouscountries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive,time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter intoagreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can beobtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also signiﬁcantly increase the Company’s cost ofsales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certainproducts and services.Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K inthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” inthe opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or amaterial loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against theCompany or an indemniﬁed third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results ofoperations and ﬁnancial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result insigniﬁcant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or proﬁts, remedial corporate measures orinjunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability tooffer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results ofoperations and ﬁnancial condition.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufﬁcient to cover alllosses or all types of claims that may arise.The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potentialliabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy,data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; ﬁnancial services and technology;product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobilecommunications; media, television, ﬁlm and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor andemployment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–moneylaundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, andclimate change.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm20/78Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect theCompany’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature tocustomers, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supplychain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will beinterpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specializedapplications, including health and ﬁnancial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensurecompliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents willnot violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws andregulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or noadvance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, theCompany is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs,policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies andprocedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be delayed orprohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operationsand ﬁnancial condition.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities,increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental,social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civilrights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governancegoals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its other non-ﬁnancial reports, information provided on itswebsite, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations andimplementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-partyperformance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announcedenvironmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals andinitiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements,comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and variedstakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adverselyaffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatoryscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market andlegal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU DigitalMarkets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extentthe Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legalproceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on theCompany’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europeand other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse ﬁndings against the Company,the Company could be exposed to signiﬁcant ﬁnes and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which couldmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. The Company is also subject tolitigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result infurther changes.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject toinvestigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercialrelationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancialcondition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services onthe Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legalproceedings.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm21/78There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by theoutcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s businesspractices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation ofthe Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products andservices, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand forproducts and services, and lost sales.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regardingdata protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of varioustypes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personalinformation among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additionaljurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may beinconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incursubstantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance couldresult in signiﬁcant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided onits website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these publicstatements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries orproceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could includeongoing audit requirements and signiﬁcant legal liability.In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company isalso subject to speciﬁc obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, ﬁnancial dataand biometric data. Health data and ﬁnancial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notiﬁcation requirements, andthe Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If theCompany fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or ﬁnancial data is handled in a manner notpermitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or ﬁnancial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation orgovernment investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur signiﬁcant fees or ﬁnes.Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information ispotentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur signiﬁcant fees or ﬁnes ifthe Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a signiﬁcant increase inpayment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data securitystandards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.Financial RisksThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to ﬂuctuate.The Company’s proﬁt margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, thegross margins on the Company’s products and services vary signiﬁcantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins aresubject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricingpressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’sability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potentialincreases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for theCompany’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products andservices, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modifyits product and service offerings; ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates; inﬂation and other macroeconomic pressures; and theintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors couldhave a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its ﬁrst quarter compared to other quarters in its ﬁscal year due in part toseasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales andoperating expenses. Further, the Company generates a signiﬁcant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demandfor that product could signiﬁcantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such aslower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, informationtechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturingpartners.', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm22/78Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 21}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm23/78The Company’s ﬁnancial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative tolocal currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, costof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that includecomponents obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreigncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demandfor the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raiseinternational pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins theCompany earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneﬁcial to the Company’s foreigncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreigncurrency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the beneﬁt. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase theCompany’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures toﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than aportion, of the adverse ﬁnancial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are inplace.The Company is exposed to credit risk and ﬂuctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, ﬁnancial results, market andeconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate ﬂuctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of theCompany’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may ﬂuctuate substantially. Therefore, although theCompany has not realized any signiﬁcant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, futureﬂuctuations in their value could result in signiﬁcant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results ofoperations and ﬁnancial condition.The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepaymentsrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers andresellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise andgovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-partybank support or ﬁnancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a signiﬁcant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can beconcentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its tradereceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also hasunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors thatmanufacture subassemblies or assemble ﬁnal products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associatedwith long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors locatedprimarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-tradereceivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoidlosses.The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure toadditional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’ssubsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-incometaxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to signiﬁcant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mixof earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction ofnew taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain,require signiﬁcant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm24/78', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm25/78The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and othertax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from theseexaminations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’staxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancialcondition could be materially adversely affected.General RisksThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, theCompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price andvolume ﬂuctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance.Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price ata given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reﬂect expectations of future growth and proﬁtability. TheCompany also believes the price of its stock should reﬂect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, andthat its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’sBoard of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speciﬁc number of shares. If theCompany fails to meet expectations related to future growth, proﬁtability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, theprice of the Company’s stock may decline signiﬁcantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor conﬁdence andemployee retention.Item 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0PropertiesThe Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California.

(“Epic”) ﬁled a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California DistrictCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon theCompany’s operation of its App Store. The Company ﬁled a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the NorthernCalifornia District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor ofthe Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certainprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epicappealed the decision. The Company ﬁled a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.Other Legal ProceedingsThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinarycourse of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregatehave a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety ofindividual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by theCompany, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchaseobligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarilynoncancelable.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assetsrelated to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation.

TheProgram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the Company’s quarterlycash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by theBoard of Directors.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its ﬁnancial condition and operating results require the Company’smanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of SigniﬁcantAccounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the signiﬁcantaccounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Management bases itsestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results ofwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain taxpositions involves signiﬁcant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws,including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believesthe Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the ﬁnal outcome of these uncertainties will not be differentfrom that which is reﬂected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such asthe closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could havea material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which areinherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonablyestimable, the determination of which requires signiﬁcant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent withmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 34}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm36/78Item 7A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk ManagementThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basisand in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s riskmanagement activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than aportion of the ﬁnancial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gainsand losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economicexposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results.Interest Rate RiskThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt.While the Company is exposed to global interest rate ﬂuctuations, it is most affected by ﬂuctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes inU.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value ofthose securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidityrequirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve itsinvestment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential riskof principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of creditexposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investmentportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of theinvestment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\\xa024, 2022and September\\xa025, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and$4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Companysold the investments prior to maturity.As of September\\xa024, 2022, the Company had outstanding ﬁxed-rate notes and as of September\\xa025, 2021, the Company had outstandingﬂoating- and ﬁxed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively.The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding termdebt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert ﬁxed-rate payments into ﬂoating-rate payments or ﬂoating-ratepayments into ﬁxed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on therelated hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt asof September\\xa024, 2022 and September\\xa025, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.Foreign Currency RiskIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and inparticular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has beensigniﬁcant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with ﬁnancial institutions to protect against foreign exchangerisks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain ﬁrmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash ﬂows and netinvestments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts topartially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Companygenerally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for upto 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, includingaccounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 35}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm37/78To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, theCompany performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of ﬂuctuations in exchangerates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assumingnormal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given conﬁdence interval, to the Company’s foreigncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is usedas a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, ﬁrm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreigncurrencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% conﬁdence, a maximumone-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September\\xa024, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million asof September\\xa025, 2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurredon those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materiallyfrom the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\\xa024, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timingand amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures

– Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and PreparationThe consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the“Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statementsand accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates andassumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts inthe consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassiﬁed to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s ﬁscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included inthe ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter every ﬁve or six years to realign the Company’s ﬁscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the ﬁrstquarter of the Company’s ﬁscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company’s ﬁscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weekseach. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s ﬁscal years ended inSeptember and the associated quarters, months and periods of those ﬁscal years.Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at theamount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generallytransferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of products orservices are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped.For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services netsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentiveprograms based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Companyallocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, theCompany uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reﬂect theCompany’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alonebasis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending uponthe unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Companyfor similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-speciﬁc business objectives and the estimated cost toprovide the performance obligation.The Company has identiﬁed up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac,iPad and certain other products. The ﬁrst performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, isthe hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certainproduct-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on awhen-and-if-available basis, future unspeciﬁed software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Companyallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Companylacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimatedSSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer,which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspeciﬁedsoftware upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale.Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspeciﬁed software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales asincurred.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For thesearrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilledconsideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and doesnot disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.®®\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 43}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm45/78For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, theCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors whendetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retainsinventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications soldthrough the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtaincontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis byrecognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collectedtaxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Share-Based CompensationThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the dateof grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further informationregarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Beneﬁt Plans.”Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in millions andshares in thousands):202220212020Numerator:Net income$99,803\\xa0$94,680\\xa0$57,411\\xa0Denominator:Weighted-average basic shares outstanding16,215,963\\xa016,701,272\\xa017,352,119\\xa0Effect of dilutive securities109,856\\xa0163,647\\xa0176,095\\xa0Weighted-average diluted shares16,325,819\\xa016,864,919\\xa017,528,214\\xa0Basic earnings per share$6.15\\xa0$5.67\\xa0$3.31\\xa0Diluted earnings per share$6.11\\xa0$5.61\\xa0$3.28\\xa0The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classiﬁed as cash equivalents.The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classiﬁed and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Companyclassiﬁes its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturitydate.The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classiﬁed based on the nature of the securities and their availability foruse in current operations.The cost of securities sold is determined using the speciﬁc identiﬁcation method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out method.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 44}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm46/78Restricted Marketable SecuritiesThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Companyreports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based onthe classiﬁcation of the underlying securities.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichfor buildings is the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and ﬁve years for machinery and equipment,including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs relatedto internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from ﬁve toseven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.7 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.7 billionduring 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Derivative Instruments and HedgingAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gainsand losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash ﬂow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred inaccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassiﬁed into earnings when the hedged transactionaffects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash ﬂow hedges,the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life ofthe hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amountsexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in theConsolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the changein value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forwardcarry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness arerecognized in OCI.Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges arerecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companyclassiﬁes cash ﬂows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in activemarkets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all otherﬁnancial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-drivenvaluations using signiﬁcant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Income TaxesThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings createdby the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).LeasesThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, datacenter and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of theCompany’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 45}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm47/78', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 46}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm48/78Segment ReportingThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internalreporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas,Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Paciﬁc. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes Europeancountries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of AsiaPaciﬁc includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportablesegments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with thelocation of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Theaccounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of SigniﬁcantAccounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographicsegments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographiclocations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directlyattributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures areincurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside thereportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research anddevelopment (“R&D”), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurringcharges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfersbetween segments for management reporting purposes.Note 2 – RevenueNet sales disaggregated by signiﬁcant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):202220212020iPhone$205,489\\xa0$191,973\\xa0$137,781\\xa0Mac 40,177\\xa035,190\\xa028,622\\xa0iPad29,292\\xa031,862\\xa023,724\\xa0Wearables, Home and Accessories 41,241\\xa038,367\\xa030,620\\xa0Services 78,129\\xa068,425\\xa053,768\\xa0Total net sales $394,328\\xa0$365,817\\xa0$274,515\\xa0(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspeciﬁed software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the salesprice of the respective product.(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini andaccessories.(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services.Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.(4)Includes $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa025, 2021, $6.7 billion ofrevenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa026, 2020, and $5.0 billion of revenue recognizedin 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa028, 2019.The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue representeda moderately higher proportion of net sales in 2022 and 2021.As of September\\xa024, 2022 and September\\xa025, 2021, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.4 billion and $11.9\\xa0billion,respectively.

There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of theﬁnancial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.Foreign Exchange RiskTo protect gross margins from ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, optioncontracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash ﬂow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions ofits forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from ﬂuctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designatesthese instruments as either cash ﬂow or fair value hedges. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the maximum length of time over which theCompany is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash ﬂows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins fromcertain ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and lossesgenerated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from ﬂuctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rateswaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash ﬂow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\\xa024, 2022 and September\\xa025, 2021 were asfollows (in millions):20222021Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$102,670\\xa0$76,475\\xa0Interest rate contracts$20,125\\xa0$16,875\\xa0Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$185,381\\xa0$126,918\\xa0Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 50}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm52/78The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September\\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):2022Fair Value ofDerivatives Designatedas Accounting HedgesFair Value ofDerivatives Not Designatedas Accounting HedgesTotalFair ValueDerivative assets :Foreign exchange contracts$4,317\\xa0$2,819\\xa0$7,136\\xa0Derivative liabilities :Foreign exchange contracts$2,205\\xa0$2,547\\xa0$4,752\\xa0Interest rate contracts$1,367\\xa0$—\\xa0$1,367\\xa0(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assetsin the Consolidated Balance Sheets.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-currentliabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk,the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fairvalues of certain derivatives ﬂuctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally entersinto master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company isallowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the potential effectsof these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction toboth derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\\xa024, 2022 and September\\xa025, 2021 were asfollows (in millions):20222021Hedged assets/(liabilities):Current and non-current marketable securities$13,378\\xa0$15,954\\xa0Current and non-current term debt$(18,739)$(17,857)Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does notrequire collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limitcredit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certaincustomers or by requiring third-party ﬁnancing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-ﬁnancing arrangements aredirectly between the third-party ﬁnancing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume anyrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of September\\xa024, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accountedfor 10%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions fromthat date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Irelandappealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15,2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the GeneralCourt’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentiallydue related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certaintaxes paid to other countries. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. Theadjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion ofall legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest overfour years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-onebasis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times thenumber of RSUs granted.

All RSUs grantedunder the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share asholders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum ofapproximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March4, 2022.2014 Employee Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grantsto employees, including executive ofﬁcers.

The Company also competes for various components with other participants in themarkets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company,including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and signiﬁcant commodity pricingﬂuctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by theCompany often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initialcapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continuedavailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production ofcommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, withsome Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Unconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplierarrangements, internet services and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with aremaining term in excess of one year as of September\\xa024, 2022, are as follows (in millions):2023$13,488\\xa020244,876\\xa020251,418\\xa020266,780\\xa02027312\\xa0Thereafter412\\xa0Total$27,286\\xa0ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have notbeen fully resolved.

As ofSeptember\\xa024, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $16.8 billion, ofwhich $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting foruncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses signiﬁcant judgment in the interpretation and application ofcomplex domestic and international tax laws.Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not tobe sustained and the measurement of the beneﬁt of various tax positions can be complex,involves signiﬁcant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 66}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm68/78How We Addressed theMatter in Our AuditWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls overmanagement’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained,management’s process to measure the beneﬁt of its tax positions, and the development of therelated disclosures.To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to besustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’sassumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities,that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.

A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\\xa0pertain to themaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of thecompany; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statements inaccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made onlyin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regardingprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effecton the ﬁnancial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections ofany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes inconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaOctober\\xa027, 2022Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 68}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm70/78Item 9.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principalexecutive ofﬁcer and principal ﬁnancial ofﬁcer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as deﬁned inRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\\xa024, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance thatinformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it ﬁles or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\\xa0recorded, processed,summarized and reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\xa0accumulated and communicated to theCompany’s management, including its principal executive ofﬁcer and principal ﬁnancial ofﬁcer, as appropriate to allow timely decisionsregarding required disclosure.Inherent Limitations over Internal ControlsThe Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancialreporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accountingprinciples (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\xa0(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions anddispositions of the Company’s assets;(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statementsin accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition ofthe Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements.Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, does not expect that the Company’s internalcontrols will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system mustreﬂect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the beneﬁts of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of theinherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues andinstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to therisk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over ﬁnancial reporting (asdeﬁned in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’sinternal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by theCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment,management has concluded that its internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was effective as of September\\xa024, 2022 to providereasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with GAAP.The Company’s independent registered public accounting ﬁrm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internalcontrol over ﬁnancial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identiﬁedin connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that havematerially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53', metadata={'source': './aapl-10-k.pdf', 'page': 69}), Document(page_content='5/7/23, 6:29 PMaapl-20220924\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm71/78Item 9B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Other InformationRule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the three months ended September\\xa024, 2022, Katherine L.
