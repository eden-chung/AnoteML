# AnoteML
## About
We are a team of 5 college students working on this project with Anote, a NYC based AI startup. We have used various ML and NLP techniques to create a chatbot to answer domain-specific questions. Specifically, we have created a chatbot that will accurately answer questions on financial documents (such as 10-K documents).
