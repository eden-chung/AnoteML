The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a  portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets   business segment. The related sales and trading revenue  generated within Global Markets  is recorded in various income  statement line items, including market making and similar  activities and net interest income as well as other revenue  categories. Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value  and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other  assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from  commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the  difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at  which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer  market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases  and sales are recorded in the “Other” column in the Sales and  Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these  securities are included in market making and similar activities.  For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest  associated with the debt securities, is typically included in funds, private equity firms, and e-commerce and other internet- based companies, including merchant banks and companies  providing nonbank financial services. We compete with some of  these competitors globally and with others on a regional or  product-specific basis. We are increasingly competing with firms  offering products solely over the internet and with non-financial  companies, including firms utilizing emerging technologies, such  as digital assets, rather than, or in addition to, traditional  banking products. Competition is based on a number of factors including,  among others, customer service and convenience, the pricing,  quality and range of products and services offered, lending  limits, the quality and delivery of our technology and our  reputation, experience and relationships in relevant markets.

Many of our significant accounting principles require complex  judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We  have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making  these judgments.  The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the  following discussion. We have identified and described the  development of the variables most important in the estimation  processes that involve mathematical models to derive the  estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative  judgments that could be used in the process of determining the  inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used  the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value  in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from  our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our  results of operations.
